# ApproxiMate
My final program for my CS417 Computational Methods and Software class. Basically an approximation program that takes x-y data as input and then approximates the functions that were used to attain the data using three different techniques, general polynomials, Legendre polynomials, and divided difference.

Run syntax is *.exe [datafile1] [limit of approximation for gen poly] [datafile2] [limit of approximation for legendre poly] [datafile3]

Included are three example files.

Requires Eigen C++ matrix library for compilation. http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
